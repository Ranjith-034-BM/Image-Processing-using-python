# Image-Processing-using-python
Image processing using Python involves manipulating digital images to perform various tasks such as enhancement, analysis, recognition, and more. Python offers several libraries and tools that make image processing tasks efficient and accessible. Some popular libraries for image processing in Python include:

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): OpenCV is one of the most widely used libraries for computer vision tasks, including image processing. It provides a vast array of functionalities for image manipulation, feature detection, object recognition, and more.

Pillow (Python Imaging Library, PIL): Pillow is a friendly fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It's great for basic image processing tasks and handling different image formats.

scikit-image: scikit-image is a collection of algorithms for image processing. It is built on top of SciPy and provides simple and efficient tools for image processing, such as filtering, morphology, segmentation, and feature extraction.

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy is often used in combination with other libraries for image processing tasks due to its array manipulation capabilities.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python that can be used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It's commonly used for visualizing images and results obtained from image processing operations.
